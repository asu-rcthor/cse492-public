# In-class activities for CSE 360
## Week 13: Black-Box Testing
An implementation of the Username Validator is given as a compiled executable.
1. Work with your team and determine a strategy to test this program. **This is a black-box test, so no source code is provided!** Use the FSM for the Username Validator from Individual Homework 1 to develop your tests.
2. Execute the program and take note of:
	* What are your test cases? Ensure that the test cases that you have selected are **thorough**.
	* What is the rationale for your test cases? (For example, is there a requirement you are trying to test?)
	* Do the test cases pass or fail? **Should** the test pass or fail?
3. All members of your team should submit the same set of test cases. **Work with your team; divide and conquer.**

### Other specifications
To execute these, clone the repository then run:
```sh
java -jar UserNameValidator21.jar
```
(you can also use `UserNameValidator17.jar` if you use Java 17)
Alternatively, you may run the jar file on pwn.college (join link is [here](https://pwn.college/dojo/asu-rcthor-thesis~b16ee020/join/) with a challenge specially prepared).
